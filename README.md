# workingStation

## Overview

This is a static webpage designed for task management and note-taking. The interface features a clean layout where users can add and mark as  complete tasks, write notes with adjustable text size and color, and utilize basic timing tools including a current time display, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer. You can export you progress to an .xml file with the "Export" button and import it later with the "Import" button for not loosing your progress.

My plan is adding new features for every update (hopefully adding also a database)

## Features

- Add todo's and mark them as completed (description of task is optional)
- Switch between in progress and completed todo's
- Notepad for writting stuff
- Change font size and color
- Choose between Hour (with current date), Chronometer and Count down
- Export and Import for saving the progress

## Requirements

A browser? Right now its just a static site

## Steps to run this locally

1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/yourUnemployedFriend/workingStation
```

2. Open index.html with your browser or use "Live Server" extension

3. Done :D

## Future Plans

- Database for saving the progress
- Add different languages
- Change theme
- Make the code actually readable ngl
- The effect button (underline, bold, etc)
- Support of images (maybe?)

## Known Bugs

- Select all text with Ctrl+A and changing color will delete the whole textArea div
